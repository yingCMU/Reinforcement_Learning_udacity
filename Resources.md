# Application of rl
- Read about TD-Gammon [Temporal Difference Learning and TD-Gammon(tesauro95cacm.pdf)], one of the first successful applications of neural networks to reinforcement learning.

- Read about [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphago-zero-starting-scratch), the state-of-the-art computer program that defeats professional human Go players.

- Learn about how reinforcement learning (RL) is used to play [Atari games](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning).

- Read about [OpenAI's bot](https://openai.com/blog/dota-2/) that beat the worldâ€™s top players of Dota 2.

- Read about [research-Producing flexible behaviours in simulated environments](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/producing-flexible-behaviours-simulated-environments) used to teach humanoid bodies to walk.

Learn about RL for self-driving cars-[MIT 6.S094: Deep Learning for Self-Driving Cars](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/).

- To see an example of RL applied to finance, check out this [final project-QLearning_Trading](https://github.com/ucaiado/QLearning_Trading) from a student who graduated from the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. You may also enjoy this [friendly introduction-Introduction to Learning to Trade with Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cnblogs.com/DjangoBlog/p/9285956.html) to learning to trade with reinforcement learning.

- Learn about [RL for telecommunication](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1740-low-power-wireless-communication-via-reinforcement-learning.pdf).

- Read this [paper-Inventory management in supply chains:a reinforcement learning approach](http://read.pudn.com/downloads142/sourcecode/others/617477/inventory%20supply%20chain/04051310570412465(1).pdf) that introduces RL for inventory management.
